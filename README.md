# Cloud Computing

1. Cloud computing is the on-demand access of computing resources—physical servers or virtual servers, data storage, networking capabilities, application development tools, software, AI-powered analytic tools, and more—over the internet with pay-per-use pricing.
2. The cloud computing model offers customers greater flexibility and scalability compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.
3. Cloud computing plays a pivotal role in our everyday lives, whether accessing a cloud application like Google Gmail, streaming a movie on Netflix or playing a cloud-hosted video game.
4. Cloud computing has also become indispensable in business settings, from small startups to global enterprises. Its many business applications include enabling remote work by making data and applications accessible from anywhere, creating the framework for seamless omnichannel customer engagement and providing the vast computing power and other resources needed to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies.
5.  A cloud services provider (CSP) manages cloud-based technology services hosted at a remote and typically makes these resources available for a pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription fee.


### Service model and Deployment model of cloud

#### Cloud service model can be classified into three groups:

    software as a service
    platform as a service
    infrastructure as a service
---
#### the deployment model can be categorised into three groups.

    -public cloud.
    -private cloud
    -hybrid cloud

### Elastic Compute Cloud
    Amazon Web service offers EC2 which is a short form of Elastic Compute Cloud
    (ECC) it is a cloud computing service offered by the Cloud Service Provider AWS. You can deploy your applications in 
    EC2 servers without any worrying about the underlying infrastructure. You configure the EC2-Instance in a very
    secure manner by using the VPC, Subnets, and Security groups. You can scale the configuration of the EC2 
    instance you have configured based on the demand of the application by attaching the autoscaling group 
    to the EC2 instance. You can scale up and scale down the instance based on the
    incoming traffic of the application.

The following figure shows the EC2-Instance which is deployed in VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
